This is also one of my personal projects, that I worked on during my free time! MyMeds is an android application that helps patients manage their medication. The idea came from my aunt who needs to manage countless medications for my grandma. 

The app allows the user to add their medications their expiry date, quantity and category. The user can then sort the medications by date or by category. Once a medication is about to become expired, the colour of the medication changes from green to yellow. Once it becomes expired, it is moved to the history page. The user also has the possibility of changing the picture of the medication.

The user can also add medications to the "pharmacy", if it is a common medication, then it would be easier to add it to the list when buying a new one. 

The app once again doesn't require an internet connection, and the data is stored locally on the phone. The app is available on my github page, and soon to the play store!
